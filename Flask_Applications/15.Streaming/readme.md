# Flask Streaming Template App

This is a simple Flask web application that demonstrates how to use streaming templates with Jinja2 to render HTML incrementally. The application displays a timeline of items, rendering them one by one to improve performance and user experience.

## Features

- Streaming of HTML content for faster initial page load.
- Dynamic rendering of items using Jinja2 templates.
- Simple and clean design.

# Overview of Streaming Templates in Flask

## Purpose

Streaming templates in Flask allow you to generate HTML in chunks rather than all at once. This approach is particularly useful for handling large templates or when you want to display content incrementally as it is generated. By streaming content, you can enhance the user experience with faster initial page loads and reduced memory consumption.

## Flask Functions

Flask provides two key functions to facilitate streaming:

- **`stream_template(template_name, **context)`**: This function allows you to render a template piece by piece. When a request is active, it wraps the output in a context that makes request data available to the template.
  
- **`stream_template_string(template_string, **context)`**: Similar to `stream_template`, but allows you to stream a template directly from a string instead of a file.

### Benefits of Streaming Templates

- **Faster Initial Load Times**: Users can see and interact with parts of the page while the rest is still loading.
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: By generating HTML in chunks, you can save memory when rendering very large templates.
- **Improved User Experience**: Content can be displayed as it becomes available, enhancing the overall experience for users.
