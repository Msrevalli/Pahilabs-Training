# Flask Session Management Project

This is a simple Flask web application that demonstrates user authentication using session management. It allows users to log in with a username and maintains their session across requests.

## Features

- User login with session management
- Secure session handling with cryptographic signing
- Simple and clean HTML interface

# Overview of Sessions in Flask

## What are Sessions?

Sessions in Flask allow you to store information specific to a user between requests. They are built on top of cookies and signed cryptographically to prevent tampering. This ensures that even though the user can view the contents of their cookies, they cannot modify them unless they possess the secret key used for signing.

### Key Features of Sessions

- **User-Specific Storage:** Sessions store user-specific data that persists across different requests, enhancing user experience.
- **Secure:** Sessions are secured through cryptographic signing, making it difficult for unauthorized parties to alter session data.
- **Cookie-Based:** Flask manages sessions using cookies, providing a lightweight and efficient means of maintaining state in web applications.

### Why Use Sessions?

Using sessions is essential for managing user authentication, preferences, and other temporary data that should remain consistent throughout a user's visit to a web application.
